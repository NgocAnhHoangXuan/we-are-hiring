## What Credify do

Think about it. You are purchasing a laptop on an online marketplace, and our products will help you to get personalized services provided by our partners, such as installment payment, damage insurance, etc. depending upon your behaviors on this marketplace. You will not even have to switch your apps to access these services! 

We work with service providers (e.g. lending, insurance, banking, etc) and markets (e.g. e-commerce, gig economy services, etc.) and __we are literally connecting these disparate platforms through our SDK and API__.

Our underlying technology that enables partners to get connected is an extensible self-sovereign identity with OpenID Connect capabilities.

## Credify's culture

### Built with the purpose

Everything we do comes with the purpose behind, from the product to every decision made. We want to enable an environment where people can freely express themselves and bring in their unique values.

If we decide to hire you, it is our duty to trust that you excel at what is expected of you. Your output is the only metric we take into account.

### International and diverse team

We are still young and small team with around 20 people, but we are proud of our diversity.

Our team is international (Japanese, American, Italian, Vietnamese, Singaporean, and Spanish) and located in Singapore (headquarter), Vietnam, and Japan. Yes, our main market is APAC, first in Vietnam.

### Tech-oriented culture

Although we have teams in 3 locations, the main team is in Vietnam, focusing on both business development and software development. We work together closely.

The CEO is from the engineering background - a core developer of TouchID (the iPhone fingerprint sensing technology), therefore, we strongly value efforts of the engineering team, as well as the business team.

### Self-driven mindset

Taking an ownership. This is one of the most important things in Credify. We do not micro manage people, rather we expect people to think by themselves and grow together. In addition to this, we endorse each other to proactively learn new things. If you stop learning new things, then the growth of your skills will stop.

## Development flow

We have a scrum development process with 2-week sprint. The product owner organizes a sprint planning the first day of a sprint to share feature requests with the team. Once it is explained, another sprint planning will be hosted by a scrum master to estimate the feature development and assign the tickets to each developer.
